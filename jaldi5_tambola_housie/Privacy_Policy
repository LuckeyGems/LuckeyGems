Tambola Fun! Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how Tambola Fun! (the "App") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our mobile application.

Tambola Fun! is designed as a local, offline game. We prioritize your privacy and aim to collect as little personal data as possible.
1. Information We Do NOT Collect Directly

Tambola Fun! is designed to be played offline and does not require user accounts, logins, or direct personal information input for its core functionality. We do not directly collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, phone number, location, or unique device identifiers from within the App for our own purposes.

All player names, ticket details, and game progress (e.g., called numbers, prize pool settings) are stored locally on your device only and are not transmitted to us or any third-party servers controlled by us. If you uninstall the App, this local data will be deleted.
2. Information Collected by Third-Party Services

While Tambola Fun! does not directly collect your personal data, it may integrate with third-party services that collect data according to their own privacy policies. These services are essential for the App's functionality, analytics, and advertising.

The primary third-party services that may collect information are:

    Google Play Services: Used for core Android functionalities and may collect anonymous usage data.

    Google AdSense / AdMob: If advertising is displayed within the App (as indicated by your AdSense snippet), Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies or device identifiers to serve ads based on your prior visits to this or other websites. Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting Ads Settings.

        Google's Privacy Policy for Advertising: https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads

    Google Analytics (if implemented): If Google Analytics code is present, it collects anonymous usage data to help us understand how users interact with the App (e.g., number of sessions, screen views, device type). This data is aggregated and does not identify you personally.

        Google Analytics Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

We do not have access to or control over the cookies or other identifiers that may be used by third-party advertisers.
3. How Information (by Third Parties) Is Used

Information collected by the aforementioned third-party services is used for purposes such as:

    Providing and maintaining the App: Ensuring the App functions correctly.

    Analytics and Usage Trends: Understanding how users interact with the App to improve its features and user experience.

    Advertising: Displaying relevant advertisements within the App.

4. Data Security

We are committed to protecting the information stored locally on your device. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
5. Children's Privacy

Tambola Fun! is designed as a game suitable for children. We do not knowingly collect any Personally Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13 directly through the App. Any data collected by third-party services (like advertising networks) is subject to their own policies and may be anonymized or aggregated. We encourage parents and guardians to monitor their children's online activity and to ensure that they understand the privacy practices of apps their children use.
6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
